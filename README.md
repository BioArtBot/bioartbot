# ARTBot Robotic Artist
This repo holds code for CCL's ARTBot project. The project takes advantage of the open-source nature of
the [Opentrons OT2 robot](www.opentrons.com) - it converts a picture drawn in an online editor submitted
as a JSON into a protocol to draw that picture on an agar art tray.
